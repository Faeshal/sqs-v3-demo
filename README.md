### Note 1 :

If you **didn't specify credentials in your Node.js code** and you were **still able** to send messages to SQS queue, it's likely that the AWS SDK for JavaScript automatically picked up credentials from one of the following sources:

1. Environment Variables: The AWS SDK automatically checks for credentials in the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. If these variables are set in your environment, the SDK will use them.

2. Shared Credentials File: The AWS SDK looks for credentials in a shared credentials file located at ~/.aws/credentials on Linux/macOS or %USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials on Windows. If you have configured credentials in this file, the SDK will use them.

3. IAM Role Assigned to the EC2 Instance: If your Node.js code is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, and that instance has an IAM role associated with it, the AWS SDK for JavaScript running on the instance will automatically use the IAM role's credentials.

4. AWS Container Services: If your Node.js code is running within an AWS service like AWS Lambda or AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service), the SDK will automatically use the IAM role associated with that service.

5. Default Credentials Chain: If none of the above methods provide credentials, the AWS SDK for JavaScript falls back to the default credential provider chain, which attempts to find credentials in the following order: environment variables, shared credentials file, IAM role assigned to the EC2 instance, and finally, container service credentials.

### Note 2 :

Whether to use one queue per task or one queue for all tasks depends on various factors such as the nature of your tasks, scalability requirements, and operational considerations. Here are some points to consider for each approach:

#### One Queue Per Task:

1. Isolation: Each task has its own dedicated queue, providing isolation between different types of tasks. This can make it easier to manage and troubleshoot individual tasks independently.

2. Scalability: You can scale individual queues independently based on the workload and throughput requirements of each task. This allows you to optimize resources and avoid resource contention between different types of tasks.

3. Priority: You can prioritize different tasks by adjusting the processing capacity or visibility timeout of their respective queues. This gives you finer control over the processing order and ensures that high-priority tasks are processed promptly.

4. Fault Isolation: If one task encounters errors or becomes overwhelmed, it won't affect the processing of other tasks since they are isolated in separate queues. This improves fault tolerance and resilience.

#### One Queue for All Tasks:

1. Simplicity: Managing a single queue is simpler and requires less overhead compared to managing multiple queues. It reduces operational complexity and simplifies resource management.

2. Resource Efficiency: A single queue can utilize resources more efficiently since messages from different tasks are processed together. This can lead to better resource utilization and cost savings, especially for small-scale applications.

3. Load Balancing: In some cases, a single queue may provide better load balancing across multiple consumers, as all tasks share the same queue and are processed based on their visibility timeout.

4. Cross-Task Dependencies: If tasks have dependencies on each other or need to be processed in a specific order, using a single queue can simplify coordination and ensure consistent processing order.

Considerations:

- Message Processing Time: If tasks have vastly different processing times, using one queue per task may be beneficial to prevent long-running tasks from blocking the processing of shorter tasks.

- Scaling Considerations: Consider the scalability requirements of your application. If you anticipate a large number of tasks with varying throughput requirements, using multiple queues may offer more flexibility and scalability.

- Operational Overhead: Managing multiple queues introduces additional operational overhead, such as monitoring, configuration, and error handling. Consider whether the benefits of isolation outweigh the increased complexity.

In conclusion, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the decision depends on your specific use case, requirements, and trade-offs between isolation, simplicity, scalability, and resource efficiency. It's important to evaluate these factors carefully and choose the approach that best aligns with your application architecture and operational needs.
